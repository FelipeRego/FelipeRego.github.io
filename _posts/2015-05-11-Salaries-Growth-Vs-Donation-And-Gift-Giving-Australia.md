title: "Intro to Classification Problems: Simple Logistic Regression for Churn Modelling"
---

This is a visualisation created using (Plotly)[www.plot.ly]. The data was sourced from the Australian Taxation Office and it relates to tax components for individuals (non-businesses) published in 2011-12 year going back for ~20 years. In this visualisation, I wanted to clearly articulate how much more Australians have increased their spending with donation and gift giving  relative to the growth experienced in their Salaries and Wages. I wanted to surface the growth proportionality between these two measures.
