title: "Temporary Skilled Migration in Australia - A Overview on 457 Visa Holders"
---
This is a mobile-friendly interactive dashboard looking at data for holders of visa subclass 457 over the past 6 years (2010-2016) in Australia. 

The 457 visa allowed businesses to employ foreign workers for a period of up to 4 years in skilled jobs where there was a shortage of Australian workers. Holders of 457 visa were allowed to bring any eligible family members with unrestricted work and study rights in Australia. The 457 visa was available since 1996 and allowed tens of thousands of foreign workers to fill jobs in hundreds of occupations.
On 18 April 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the 457 visas will be replaced by two new visa categories. The government claims that the changes are part of a reform package to stregthen the integrity and quality of Australia's temporary and permanent employer sponsored skilled migration programmes. 

This viz was a first attempt at creating a dashboard to be exclusively consumed via mobile devices. Share your feedback!
