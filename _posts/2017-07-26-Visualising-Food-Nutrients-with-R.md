Below is an interactive dashboard I built to showcase [Shiny](http://www.shinyapps.io/) and [flexdashboards](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) in R. These tools are really cool and have a good and flexible approach to creating visualisations and dashboards, using the power and awesomeness of R and markdowns.

Data is based on the *food nutrient database* from the [Food Starndards website](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/science/monitoringnutrients/ausnut/ausnutdatafiles/Pages/foodnutrient.aspx). The Food Standards is a independent statutory agency established by the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 (FSANZ Act).

Note: In case you're reading this blog post from your mobile, this vis has also been published via the [shinyapp.io](https://feliperego.shinyapps.io/visualising_food_nutrients_with_interactive_r_dashboard/) website which can make the experience in smaller screens a bit better.
