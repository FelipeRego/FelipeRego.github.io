title: "Visualising growth in Salary vs Donation in Australia over the past 20 years."
---

This is a visualisation created using [www.plot.ly] The data was sourced from the Australian Taxation Office and it relates to two tax components/measures for individuals (non-businesses) published in 2011-12 year going back for ~20 years. In this visualisation, I wanted to clearly articulate how much more Australians have increased their spending with donation and gift giving relative to the growth experienced in their Salaries and Wages over this relatively long period of time.
