title: "Visualisation & Storytelling - Best Practices and Examples in the Context of Data Analytics"
---

This is a bunch of slides I put together for a talk I gave recently on data visualisation and storytelling in the context of analytics. 
The content was a mix of my own experience in industry and teaching and also from the work of Edward Tufte, Nathan Yau, Angela Zoss, Peter Beshai, Mike Bostock, General Assembly among others.
In this presentation, I wanted to highlight what data visualisation is and what are the fundamental steps I take to create data dashboards and visualisations.
It also contains a bunch of examples that are both clean, interactive and effective in displaying data.
