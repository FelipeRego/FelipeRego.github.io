As an independent data science partner, I help teams build, manage and enhance their data science and visualisation solutions in a strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented and customer-centred way.

With an extensive industry experience as well as a deep, technical analytical expertise, I am often required by marketing, sales, finance, technology and strategy teams to provide support and to deliver robust analytics-driven solutions that are easy to use, undestand and implement.


I specialise in:

### Data Discovery & Exploratory Data Analysis ###  
- I partner with teams to help identify sources, types and quality of data available in their organsations. I also provide robust exploratory data analyses that help teams identify patterns and generate initial insights for their businesses. 

### Interactive Data Visualisation Dashboards ###    
- I partner with teams to provide them automated, interactive data visualisation dashboards about their customers, products or services to help monitor and improve performance.

### Predictive Analytics ###    
- I partner with teams to implement customer, product or market segmentation models, sales forecast, propensity models, credit risk, recommender systems and many other analytical solutions to optimise business operations, antecipate the future and enhance decision-making.

### Analytics Project Management###
- I provide organisations with a good balance between technical, practical analytical skills as well as business, strategy and project management experience. With a track record of leading and nurturing high-performing analytics teams, organisations rely on me to help them take their analytics' journey to the next level.


I bring a distinctive balance between practical analytical knowhow, implementing and deploying technical data science solutions as well as a solid experience translating business problems into data science solutions, managing analytical teams and delivering analytical projects in a variety of settings.


# Success stories:

"The art of storytelling is in allowing your audience to join the teller for the entire journey; to use language in such a way that meaning and movement are conveyed so the listener is part of the unfolding story. In any data-heavy business, it is rare to come come across a master of data storytelling who can convey what the data is saying, and not just what it is showing up in the numbers.  In my work with Felipe he approached the problem we were trying to solve in a calm and collected manner, asking the right questions to understand what we wanted to know, which wasn't necessarily what we thought we needed. Even with an overflowing plate of work on his hands he was able to develop a framework and execute a connected 'live' platform that delivered the insights we needed. In addition he provided my team at [...]  (and my [...] team) an overview of data visualization that gave us a core understanding of the 'why' of data storytelling.  Felipe is a consummate professional in the data science space, a great team member and all around good guy. I highly recommend Felipe if you want someone who can grow and mold with the flow of your business and tell the right data story to anyone in your organization."

"Felipe brought in my team to stand up a novel, unprecedented financial reporting capability for the business in just over a month. Expectations were high with a lot of moving parts requiring a lot of faith and a lot of communication with diverse stakeholders across the country, and Felipe brought everyone along the journey. His ability to listen, lead, learn and explain were instrumental to the project's success. I highly recommend him to anyone considering such an effort and hoping for a similar result or better."

"Felipe is very efficient at delivering highly technical knowledge. His teaching and mentoring methods are very engaging while also challenging. Felipe's real-life example approach made the Data Analytics course even more valuable; and provided me with the confidence to incorporate advanced data analysis into my current job."

"Felipe is good at using R on several kinds of analytics. He could also explain the complexed things in an easier way. I read his blog posts and they are very helpful. Look forward to see lots of analytic posts there. Good Job."

"Felipe was my predecessor of my previous analytical role at [...]. [...] I see him as a great mentor. I have learned more from reading through his old files than I would have ever done by myself. From creating business models to writing commentaries, from coding efficient SQLs to designing graphs and charts, I have grown so much in analytics and market research just via “stealing” from Felipe’s old works. Thank you very much, Felipe, I am absolutely grateful for the legacy you left to the company and to me."

"I had the pleasure of working with Felipe for almost two years. His skill set and attention to detail was second to none, hence why I would leverage his abilities on a regular basis to support my sales role. Without Felipe’s help and support I feel that I would not have been as successful and with this in mind I would recommend him to any company as he would be a valuable asset."
