# Success stories:

"The art of storytelling is in allowing your audience to join the teller for the entire journey; to use language in such a way that meaning and movement are conveyed so the listener is part of the unfolding story. In any data-heavy business, it is rare to come come across a master of data storytelling who can convey what the data is saying, and not just what it is showing up in the numbers.  In my work with Felipe he approached the problem we were trying to solve in a calm and collected manner, asking the right questions to understand what we wanted to know, which wasn't necessarily what we thought we needed. Even with an overflowing plate of work on his hands he was able to develop a framework and execute a connected 'live' platform that delivered the insights we needed. In addition he provided my team at [...]  (and my [...] team) an overview of data visualization that gave us a core understanding of the 'why' of data storytelling.  Felipe is a consummate professional in the data science space, a great team member and all around good guy. I highly recommend Felipe if you want someone who can grow and mold with the flow of your business and tell the right data story to anyone in your organization."

"Felipe brought in my team to stand up a novel, unprecedented financial reporting capability for the business in just over a month. Expectations were high with a lot of moving parts requiring a lot of faith and a lot of communication with diverse stakeholders across the country, and Felipe brought everyone along the journey. His ability to listen, lead, learn and explain were instrumental to the project's success. I highly recommend him to anyone considering such an effort and hoping for a similar result or better."

"Felipe is very efficient at delivering highly technical knowledge. His teaching and mentoring methods are very engaging while also challenging. Felipe's real-life example approach made the Data Analytics course even more valuable; and provided me with the confidence to incorporate advanced data analysis into my current job."

"Felipe is good at using R on several kinds of analytics. He could also explain the complexed things in an easier way. I read his blog posts and they are very helpful. Look forward to see lots of analytic posts there. Good Job."

"Felipe was my predecessor of my previous analytical role at [...]. [...] I see him as a great mentor. I have learned more from reading through his old files than I would have ever done by myself. From creating business models to writing commentaries, from coding efficient SQLs to designing graphs and charts, I have grown so much in analytics and market research just via “stealing” from Felipe’s old works. Thank you very much, Felipe, I am absolutely grateful for the legacy you left to the company and to me."

"I had the pleasure of working with Felipe for almost two years. His skill set and attention to detail was second to none, hence why I would leverage his abilities on a regular basis to support my sales role. Without Felipe’s help and support I feel that I would not have been as successful and with this in mind I would recommend him to any company as he would be a valuable asset."
