<h3>About the program</h3>
<strong>Engaging, interactive and practical sessions</strong>


The program is  delivered live and online taking an applied perspective to create an exclusive, highly engaging and practical experience. Participants of this program are not required to have any previous knowledge. 

Throughout the sessions, participants engage in a variety of activities and are encouraged to think both individually and in group on all aspects of a project. Activities performed are driven by frameworks and learnings discussed during the sessions. Practical exercises are subsequently applied via various methods (discussion, role-play, visual sketches, narrative development, etc) utilising common stationery resources (texters, sharpies, colourful pens, blank papers, post-it notes, etc.). 

The delivery rhythm throughout the session is highly approachable, encouraging of participation and inviting to all backgrounds. Itâ€™s purposely built for an active and relevant learning experience. 

 Participants apply their learnings utilising the resources and references provided with real-life case studies and benchmarks and are also encouraged to think / reference their own specific on-the-job work and projects (where appropriate and where privacy and confidentially have been assessed and considered).
