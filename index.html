<p>Hi there, I'm Felipe. I'm an <a href="https://feliperego.github.io/about">advanced analytics and data visualisation consultant</a>. As an independent data science partner, I help teams make analytics solutions really work for their organisations.</p>

<p>I'm also an <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/felipe-rego/7721">analytics instructor</a> helping disseminate practical, actionable analytics and data visualisation techniques in both classrooms and online settings.</p>

<p>When I'm not partnering with clients or helping students, I'm an <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/felipe.carbonerego.830.php">M.Phil. research candidate</a> in Learning Analytics at the University of Sydney making sense of students' digital traces and the role learning analytics dashboards play in influencing learning outcomes.</p>

<p>I'm also a <a href="https://feliperego.github.io/blog">blogger</a> in predictive analytics, statistical learning and data visualisation, a husband and a father of two.</p>

<p>II'm available to consult, advise and/or develop advanced data analytics and visualisation solutions with marketing, digital, sales, operations, finance, technology and strategy teams across Australia.<p>
