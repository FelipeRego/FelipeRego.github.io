<h2>Delivering Business Intelligence to Boost Sales and Stock Efficiency</h2>

<br>



<h3>The Project</h3>

<strong>Redsbaby, a rapidly growing player in the baby and toddler consumer goods sector</strong>, aimed to enhance their business monitoring capabilities with a particular focus on sales, stock and merchandising data. The initiative sought to harness the power of PowerBI dashboards to establish a robust business intelligence (BI) reporting system. This system was envisioned to not only streamline operations but also to unlock predictive insights for stock management and optimisation.


<h3>Objectives</h3>

<strong>From Data to Decision, Streamlining Stock with Smart BI Insights</strong>

The project set to elevate Redsbaby's operations, focusing on advanced stock monitoring, insightful merchandising planning, and faster decision-making through predictive analytics and efficient inventory optimization.

The project was designed to achieve several critical objectives:

- Enhanced monitoring of stock data.
- Improved insights into merchandising planning and stock turns.
- A reduction in time to insight for strategic decision-making.
- Predictive forecasting of stock levels to optimize the ordering process.
- Optimisation to minimize overstocking and backorders.



<h3>Methodology</h3>

<strong>Co-designed Dashboard Insights with Precision and Relevance</strong>

The methodology employed a comprehensive and collaborative approach. After an initial investigation into Redsbaby's data infrastructure, the project moved into a co-design phase with the founders. This collaboration was crucial for tailoring the dashboard to highlight essential metrics and incorporate analytics capabilities. The development focused on creating an intuitive interface that not only presented real-time data but also offered forecasting tools to predict stock levels and optimize the ordering and purchasing process.



<h3>Results</h3>

<strong>Rapid Deployment, Quicker Insights, Significant Results</strong>

Redsbaby experienced a remarkable transformation with the swift implementation of the BI reporting system, which went live in just over two weeks. The impact was immediate and profound: a significant acceleration in the decision-making process was achieved, with the time-to-insight reduced by an estimated threefold. The introduction of forecasting and order optimisation features helped reduce overstocking and backorder costs by an estimated six figures.


 
<blockquote>”The PowerBI dashboard Felipe helped us with has revolutionised how we approach stock management and ordering processes. The analytics features implemented have not only enhanced our operational efficiency but also led to significant cost savings by helping us optimise our inventory levels. It's truly been a monumental shift in our business operations.”<strong>- Brett Redelman, Co-Founder and Operations Director, Redsbaby</strong></blockquote>
