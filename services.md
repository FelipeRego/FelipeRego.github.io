<h3>Data Science &amp; Analytics Strategy</h3>
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/analyticsstrategy1.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> Organisation often struggle to find a clear roadmap for their data science and analytics strategy. They are inundated with data and technologies but end up drowning with options. Through a robust, proprietary framework and methodology (DASAMA), Felipe helps organisations make sense of their current analytics capability and provide them with a clear roadmap to find future growth opportunities. Felipe brings a distinctive balance between technical know-how and business experience. Felipe can build complex yet easy-to-understand analytical solutions combined with a solid, clear and actionable commercial structure around it.

<h3>Predictive Analytics &amp; Machine Learning Solutions</h3>
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/machinelearning1.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> Organisations are generally uncertain about how to best tackle a certain problem using data science and often don't have the right skillset in-house to produce high-quality results. From simple predictive analytics models to complex algorithms, Felipe partners with teams to devise and implement a variety of machine learning solutions. From marketers requiring a more robust segmentation model of their customers or a recommendation engine for their products to sales and finance leaders wanting to improve their forecasting ability, Felipe helps organisations implement machine learning to optimise operations, anticipate the future and enhance decision-making with a strong commercial mindset.

<h3>Data Visualisation &amp; Insights Automation</h3>
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/datavisservice1.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> Making sense of vast amounts of data in a way that produces compelling and actionable storytelling is no easy feat. It's still very common for organisations of any size to rely on old, inappropriate  technologies to generate insights that are, at best, suboptimal. Using the latest techniques and platforms, Felipe partners with teams to help unclutter their data assets and provide them with clean, automated, interactive, actionable and beautiful data visualisation solutions that are scalable. As a result, organisations can become more transparent and seamlessly monitor their performance.

<h3>Analytical Training &amp; Corporate Workshops</h3>
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/training1.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> As data analytics becomes an important source of competitive advantage, many organisations and individuals are realising they need to upskill some of their talent to be able to leverage the power of analytics in their business and lives. Felipe partners with both educational institutions and corporate organisations to help disseminate practical, actionable and easy-to-understand data science, predictive analytics and data visualisation techniques to students and staff. Organisations end up with a more engaged workforce and individuals feel more prepared to step up to their next challenge.
